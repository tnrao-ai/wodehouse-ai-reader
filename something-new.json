        "At the door of the Piccadilly branch of the London and Suburban Bank, Ashe Marson paused. It was a sideways pause, inconclusive. He was not one of those strong, curt men who stride ever onward, breasting the world. He was a nervous young man, and the consciousness that he was in a false position made him more nervous. He had come to the bank to deposit a thousand pounds. He had the money in his pocket, in a stout envelope. But he had not the courage to go in. He had a feeling that the commissionaire would not believe him, that the cashier would summon the manager, and that the manager would refuse to take the money.",
        "He was a young man of twenty-five, tall and thin, with a long, thin nose and a worried expression. He was a writer of stories for the magazines. He had a small and precarious income, and he had never had a thousand pounds in his life before. He had come by it in a curious way. An American millionaire, who had read one of his stories, had taken a fancy to him, and had commissioned him to write a series of stories about a character named Lester, a young man who was always getting into trouble. The millionaire, who had a sense of humour, had paid him a thousand pounds in advance.",
        "Ashe Marson had never seen a thousand pounds before. He had never seen more than fifty pounds at a time. The sight of all this money had unnerved him. He had a feeling that it was not real, that it would vanish if he touched it. He had a feeling that he was not a fit person to be entrusted with such a sum. He had a feeling that he would lose it, or be robbed of it, or that it would be taken from him in some way. He had a feeling that he ought to go and hide it somewhere.",
        "He had been walking about with it in his pocket for two days, and he was beginning to feel the strain. He had not slept well. He had had nightmares. He had dreamed that he had lost the money, and had woken up in a cold perspiration. He had dreamed that he had been robbed of it, and had woken up shouting for the police. He had dreamed that the bank had refused to take it, and had woken up feeling that he was a marked man.",
        "He had come to the conclusion that he must get rid of it. He must put it in a bank. He must get it off his mind. He must place it in a safe place, where it would be out of his reach. He must deposit it. That was the word. He must deposit it.",
        "He had chosen the Piccadilly branch of the London and Suburban Bank because it was the nearest. He had never been inside a bank before, and he did not know how to behave. He did not know what to say. He did not know what to do. He did not know whether he ought to go to the counter and say, ‘I want to deposit a thousand pounds,’ or whether he ought to go to a desk and write out a slip. He did not know whether he ought to ask for a receipt, or whether the bank would give him one without being asked. He did not know whether he ought to count the money in front of the cashier, or whether he ought to hand it over in the envelope. He did not know whether he ought to tip the commissionaire, or whether the commissionaire would be insulted if he did.",
        "He was in a state of nervous prostration. He was a man who was not used to banks. He was a man who was not used to money. He was a man who was not used to life.",
        "He was standing on the pavement, hesitating, when a girl came out of the bank. She was a pretty girl, with a fresh complexion and a determined chin. She was a girl who looked as if she knew her way about. She was a girl who looked as if she were not afraid of banks, or of anything else. She was a girl who looked as if she were used to life.",
        "She saw him standing there, and she smiled. She was a girl who had a friendly smile. She was a girl who had a kind heart. She was a girl who was sorry for nervous young men.",
        "‘Can I help you?’ she said.",
        "Ashe Marson was a shy young man, but he was not so shy that he could not speak to a pretty girl who smiled at him in a friendly way. He was a young man who had a weakness for pretty girls. He was a young man who had a weakness for kindness.",
        "‘I want to deposit some money,’ he said.",
        "‘Why don’t you go in and do it?’ she said.",
        "‘I’m afraid,’ he said.",
        "‘Afraid? What are you afraid of?’",
        "‘I’m afraid of the bank.’",
        "She laughed. She was a girl who had a pleasant laugh. She was a girl who had a sense of humour. She was a girl who was not afraid of anything.",
        "‘Come with me,’ she said. ‘I’ll show you what to do.’",
        "She took him by the arm and led him into the bank. She led him to a desk and gave him a pen. She showed him how to fill up a paying-in slip. She took him to the counter and introduced him to the cashier. She made him count the money and hand it over. She made him ask for a receipt. She did everything for him. She was a girl who was used to managing people. She was a girl who was used to having her own way.",
        "When it was all over, he thanked her. He was a grateful young man. He was a young man who was not used to kindness.",
        "‘It was nothing,’ she said. ‘I was glad to help you.’",
        "‘But it was a great deal,’ he said. ‘I should never have dared to do it by myself.’",
        "‘You’re a funny boy,’ she said. ‘You ought to have more confidence in yourself.’",
        "‘I know,’ he said. ‘But I haven’t.’",
        "‘You ought to try,’ she said. ‘You ought to make an effort.’",
        "‘I will,’ he said. ‘I’ll begin now.’",
        "‘That’s the spirit,’ she said. ‘Good-bye.’",
        "‘Good-bye,’ he said.",
        "She went out of the bank, and he was left alone. He was a new man. He was a man who had found himself. He was a man who had been given a new lease of life. He was a man who had been born again."

        "In a corner of the smoking-room of the Senior Conservative Club, a politician was reading a newspaper. He was a large, stout, prosperous-looking man, with a bald head and a pair of shrewd, grey eyes. He was a man who had made his mark in the world. He was a man who had a future before him. He was a man who was going to be a Cabinet Minister.",
        "He was reading the paper with a frown of displeasure. He was a man who did not like to be displeased. He was a man who was accustomed to having his own way. He was a man who was used to being obeyed.",
        "The paper he was reading was the _Daily Leader_. It was a paper that was not in sympathy with his political views. It was a paper that was always attacking him. It was a paper that was always saying nasty things about him. It was a paper that he cordially disliked.",
        "He had just come to a paragraph that made him frown more than ever. It was a paragraph that was headed ‘A Word to the Wise.’ It was a paragraph that was written in a style of offensive familiarity. It was a paragraph that was full of thinly-veiled insinuations. It was a paragraph that was calculated to make a man’s blood boil.",
        "The politician was not a man whose blood boiled easily. He was a man of a calm and phlegmatic temperament. He was a man who was not easily moved. But this paragraph moved him. It moved him to a state of cold and concentrated fury.",
        "He read it through twice, and then he crumpled up the paper and threw it into the fire. He was a man who did not believe in preserving unpleasant things. He was a man who believed in getting rid of them.",
        "He sat for a moment, thinking. He was a man of a practical turn of mind. He was a man who did not waste time in idle anger. He was a man who believed in action.",
        "He rose from his chair and went to the telephone. He was a man who did not believe in writing letters when he could use the telephone. He was a man who believed in getting things done quickly.",
        "He asked for a number, and waited. He was a man who did not believe in being kept waiting. He was a man who was used to being attended to promptly.",
        "A voice answered him. It was the voice of a man who was trying to be polite, but who was not succeeding very well. It was the voice of a man who was in a state of nervous agitation. It was the voice of a man who was afraid of something.",
        "‘Is that the _Daily Leader_?’ said the politician.",
        "‘Yes,’ said the voice.",
        "‘I want to speak to the editor.’",
        "‘Who is that speaking?’",
        "‘This is Mr. John Preston.’",
        "There was a pause. The politician could hear the sound of a man gasping for breath. He could hear the sound of a man trying to swallow something that had stuck in his throat. He could hear the sound of a man trying to pull himself together.",
        "‘One moment, Mr. Preston,’ said the voice. ‘I will put you through.’",
        "There was another pause. The politician waited, with a grim smile on his face. He was a man who enjoyed making people uncomfortable. He was a man who enjoyed making people afraid of him.",
        "A new voice spoke. It was a voice that was trying to be firm, but that was not succeeding very well. It was the voice of a man who was trying to be dignified, but who was not succeeding at all. It was the voice of a man who was in a state of extreme terror.",
        "‘Is that Mr. Preston?’ said the voice.",
        "‘Yes,’ said the politician.",
        "‘This is the editor of the _Daily Leader_.’",
        "‘I know,’ said the politician. ‘I want to have a word with you.’",

        "‘What it means, Mr. Preston?’",
        "‘Yes. What it means.’",
        "There was a pause. The politician could hear the sound of a man trying to moisten his lips with a dry tongue. He could hear the sound of a man trying to think of something to say.",
        "‘It is a little difficult to explain, Mr. Preston.’",
        "‘Is it?’ said the politician. ‘Then I will explain it to you. It means that you have been trying to blackmail me.’",
        "‘Blackmail, Mr. Preston?’",
        "‘Yes. Blackmail.’",
        "‘But, my dear Mr. Preston, I assure you—’",
        "‘Don’t assure me of anything,’ said the politician. ‘Just listen to me. I am going to give you a piece of advice.’",
        "‘Yes, Mr. Preston?’",
        "‘My advice to you is to be very careful.’",
        "‘Careful, Mr. Preston?’",
        "‘Yes. Very careful indeed. Because if you are not, you will find yourself in a very unpleasant position.’",
        "‘Unpleasant, Mr. Preston?’",
        "‘Yes. Very unpleasant. You will find yourself in the dock.’",
        "‘The dock, Mr. Preston?’",
        "‘Yes. The dock. Charged with criminal libel.’",
        "There was a pause. The politician could hear the sound of a man trying to breathe. He could hear the sound of a man trying to keep from fainting.",
        "‘I think I understand you, Mr. Preston,’ said the voice.",
        "‘I am glad of that,’ said the politician. ‘Because I am a man of my word. Good morning.’",
        "He hung up the receiver and went back to his chair. He was a man who felt that he had done a good morning’s work. He was a man who felt that he had put the fear of God into somebody. He was a man who felt that he had earned his lunch."

        "In a small and dingy office in a side-street off the Strand, a young man was sitting at a desk, writing. He was a young man with a pale, intellectual face and a pair of large, horn-rimmed spectacles. He was a young man who looked as if he had been brought up on a diet of high-brow literature. He was a young man who looked as if he had never done a day’s work in his life.",

        "Ashe Marson knew this, but he did not care. He was a young man who had no illusions. He was a young man who took life as he found it. He was a young man who was not particular.",
        "He had been editor of _Society Spice_ for six months, and he was beginning to get used to it. He was beginning to get used to the dingy office, and the broken-down furniture, and the smell of stale tobacco. He was beginning to get used to the proprietor, who was a man named Mr. Zizzbaum. He was beginning to get used to everything.",
        "He was writing an article on the latest society scandal. It was a very spicy article. It was an article that was full of innuendo and suggestion. It was an article that was calculated to make the reader’s hair stand on end. It was an article that was a disgrace to journalism.",
        "Ashe Marson knew this, but he did not care. He was a young man who had to earn his living. He was a young man who had to please his proprietor. He was a young man who had to give the public what it wanted.",

        "He picked up the novel and tried to read, but he could not concentrate his mind on it. He was a young man who was in no mood for romance. He was a young man who was in a mood for reality.",
        "He threw the book aside and began to pace up and down the room. He was a young man who was trying to think. He was a young man who was trying to find a way out of his difficulties. He was a young man who was trying to find a mother for his Aline."

She was a girl who looked as if she had a great deal of common sense.",
        "This was Joan Valentine. She was a girl who had a mission in life. She was a girl who was going to make a man of her brother.",

        "He had written another story, and another, and another. He had begun to get into the way of it. He had begun to find that it was not so bad after all. He had begun to take an interest in his work. He had begun to feel that he was a writer.",
        "He was writing a story now. It was a story about a young man who was in love with a girl, and who had to make a fortune before he could marry her. It was a story that was full of incident and adventure. It was a story that was full of local colour. It was a story that was going to be a great success.",

        "‘Did he?’ said Joan. ‘He must have been drunk.’",
        "‘He was,’ said the Earl. ‘But that doesn’t matter. The point is that I’m in great trouble, and I want you to help me.’",

She was a girl who looked as if she had come to share their enjoyment. She was a girl who looked as if she had come to join in their laughter.",
        "This was Joan. She was a girl who was very fond of a good joke. She was a girl who was very fond of a good story. She was a girl who was very fond of a good book.",
        "‘What are you two laughing at?’ she said.",
        "‘We are reading a book,’ said Sir John.",
        "‘A very funny book,’ said Thomas.",
        "‘What is it?’",
        "‘It is the new novel by your husband.’",
        "‘By Dreever? Is it as good as his first?’",
        "‘It is better.’",
        "‘It is a masterpiece.’",
        "‘It is a work of genius.’",
        "‘It is the funniest book I have ever read.’",
        "‘It is the wittiest book I have ever read.’",
        "‘It is the cleverest book I have ever read.’",
        "‘It is the most original book I have ever read.’",
        "Joan looked at them with a pair of shining eyes. She was a girl who was very proud of her husband. She was a girl who was very much in love with her husband. She was a girl who was very happy.",
        "‘I am so glad you like it,’ she said.",
        "‘Like it?’ said Sir John. ‘We adore it.’",
        "‘We think it is the greatest book of the year,’ said Thomas.",
        "‘We think your husband is the greatest writer of the day,’ said Sir John.",
        "‘We think he is a second Mark Twain,’ said Thomas.",
        "‘We think he is a second O. Henry,’ said Sir John.",
        "‘We think he is a second—’",
        "He was interrupted by the entrance of a footman. He was a footman who looked as if he had a message to deliver. He was a footman who looked as if he had something on his mind.",
        "‘A gentleman to see you, Sir John,’ he said.",
        "‘A gentleman? Who is he?’",
        "‘He did not give his name, Sir John. He said that he was an old friend.’",
        "‘An old friend? I have no old friends.’",
        "‘So I ventured to tell him, Sir John. But he was very insistent.’",
        "‘Well, show him in.’",
        "A moment later, a man came into the room. He was a small, stout, bald-headed man, with a red face and a pair of cunning little eyes. He was a man who looked as if he had been through a great deal of trouble. He was a man who looked as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders.",
        "It was Mr. Zizzbaum.",
        "Sir John looked at him with a pair of startled eyes. He was a man who was not used to being surprised. He was a man who was not used to seeing ghosts. He was a man who was very much taken aback.",
        "‘Mr. Zizzbaum!’ he said.",
        "‘The same,’ said Mr. Zizzbaum. ‘And I have come to see you about a little matter of business.’",
        "‘Business?’ said Sir John.",
        "‘Yes. Business. The business of a new magazine.’",
        "‘A new magazine? But you have just had a new magazine.’",
        "‘I know. But this is a different kind of new magazine. This is a new new magazine.’",
        "‘A new new magazine? What do you mean?’",
        "‘I mean that it is a magazine that is going to be a success. It is a magazine that is going to be a gold-mine. It is a magazine that is going to be the talk of the town.’",
        "‘What sort of a magazine?’",
        "‘A magazine of fiction.’",
        "‘A magazine of fiction?’",
        "‘Yes. A magazine that will publish the best stories by the best authors. A magazine that will be a joy to the nation.’",
        "‘But who is going to edit it?’",
        "‘You are.’",
        "‘I?’ said Sir John.",
        "‘Yes. You and your brother.’",
        "‘We?’ said Thomas.",
        "‘Yes. You two. You are the very men for the job. You have the taste. You have the judgment. You have the literary sense.’",
        "‘But we are not editors.’",
        "‘You will be. I will make you editors. I will make you the greatest editors in the world.’",
        "‘But we are not businessmen.’",
        "‘You will be. I will make you businessmen. I will make you the richest businessmen in the world.’",
        "‘But we are not publishers.’",
        "‘You will be. I will make you publishers. I will make you the most famous publishers in the world.’",
        "He looked at them with a pair of beaming eyes. He was a man who was full of enthusiasm. He was a man who was full of optimism. He was a man who was full of confidence.",
        "Sir John and Thomas looked at each other with a pair of dazed eyes. They were two men who were not used to being offered a new life. They were two men who were not used to being offered a new career. They were two men who were not used to being offered a new hope.",
        "‘What do you say?’ said Mr. Zizzbaum.",
        "‘We will do it,’ said Sir John.",
        "‘We will,’ said Thomas.",
        "‘Good,’ said Mr. Zizzbaum. ‘Then that is settled. And we will call the magazine “The Argosy.”’",
        "‘“The Argosy?”’ said Sir John.",
        "‘Yes. “The Argosy.” Because it will be a magazine that will bring treasures from all parts of the world.’",
        "‘And what will be its motto?’ said Thomas.",
        "‘Its motto?’ said Mr. Zizzbaum. ‘Its motto will be “The Best of the Old, the Best of the New.”’",
        "‘And what will be its policy?’ said Sir John.",
        "‘Its policy?’ said Mr. Zizzbaum. ‘Its policy will be to give the public what it wants.’",
        "‘And what will be its aim?’ said Thomas.",
        "‘Its aim?’ said Mr. Zizzbaum. ‘Its aim will be to find something new.’"

        "In a large and beautiful garden in a large and beautiful country house, a young man and a girl were sitting on a bench, under a cedar tree. They were a very happy couple. They were a very devoted couple. They were a very much-in-love couple.",
        "They were the Earl and Countess of Dreever. They had been married for two years, and they were still on their honeymoon. They were still in the seventh heaven of delight. They were still in a state of blissful ecstasy.",
        "They were talking about their future. They were a young couple who had a great deal to talk about. They were a young couple who had a great deal to look forward to. They were a young couple who had a great deal to be thankful for.",
        "‘What are you thinking about, Dreever?’ said Joan.",
        "‘I am thinking about my next novel,’ said the Earl.",
        "‘Your next novel? But you have only just finished your last one.’",
        "‘I know. But I am a man who cannot be idle. I am a man who must be always working. I am a man who has a message to deliver.’",
        "‘A message? What is it?’",
        "‘It is a message of happiness. It is a message of contentment. It is a message of peace.’",

        "‘I know. But this novel is going to be different.’",
        "‘Different? How?’",
        "‘This novel is going to be a masterpiece.’",
        "Joan looked at him with a pair of smiling eyes. She was a girl who was very fond of her husband’s little vanities. She was a girl who was very fond of her husband’s little ambitions. She was a girl who was very much in love.",
        "‘You are a dear,’ she said. ‘And what is your new novel going to be about?’",
        "‘It is going to be about a young man who is in love with a girl, and who has to make a fortune before he can marry her.’",
        "‘But that is the plot of all your last novels.’",

        "‘Different? How?’",
        "‘My young man is not going to inherit a fortune, or earn one, or steal one. He is going to be given one.’",
        "‘Given one? By whom?’",
        "‘By his wife.’",
        "‘His wife? But he is not married.’",

        "Joan looked at him with a pair of admiring eyes. She was a girl who was very fond of her husband’s originality. She was a girl who was very fond of her husband’s humour. She was a girl who was very much impressed.",
        "‘Dreever,’ she said, ‘you are a genius.’",

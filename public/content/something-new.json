        "On a fine afternoon in the spring, a young man of pleasing exterior, but with an expression of such deep gloom on his face that he might have been a tidy-minded Cain, was leaning over the battlements of Blandings Castle. He was gazing into the middle distance with a moody frown. A more energetic man would have cursed. This young man had not the energy. He merely brooded.",
        "A voice at his elbow broke in upon his thoughts.",
        "“Fine afternoon, Mr. Ashe.”",
        "The young man turned. A solidly-built, elderly man, with a round, red, clean-shaven face and an air of comfortable prosperity, was standing beside him.",
        "“Yes,” said the young man.",
        "“Nice view from here,” said the elderly man.",
        "“Yes.”"

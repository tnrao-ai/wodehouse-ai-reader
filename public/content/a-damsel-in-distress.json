        "On a morning in the spring of the year 1919, George Bevan was interrupted in his work by the advent of his friend, Bill, who had come, as was his custom, to talk things over.",
        "George was a composer. He was an American, and had come to London to compose. He had composed a musical comedy, which had been produced, and had run for a year. He was now composing another. He was a serious young man, with a high forehead and a firm chin. He was also a very rich young man. His father had been a millionaire, and had left him all his money. George had a flat in Piccadilly, a valet, a motor-car, and everything that a young man could desire. He was, in fact, a very fortunate young man.",
        "Bill was a journalist. He was an Englishman, and had come to London to write. He had written a novel, which had not been published. He was now writing another. He was a serious young man, with a high forehead and a firm chin. He was also a very poor young man. His father had been a country clergyman, and had left him nothing but a classical education and a sense of humour. Bill had a room in Bloomsbury, a landlady, a typewriter, and nothing that a young man could desire. He was, in fact, a very unfortunate young man."

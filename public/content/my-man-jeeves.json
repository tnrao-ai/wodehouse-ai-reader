        "I’m not absolutely certain of my facts, but I rather fancy it’s Shakespeare who says that it’s always just when a chappie is feeling particularly top-hole, and more than usually braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with a bit of lead piping. There’s no doubt the man was right. It’s been that way with me time and again. Take, for instance, the business of my Aunt Agatha and the Stolen Stays. The first intimation I had that things were about to go wrong was on a morning in early spring, when I was brushing my hair. It was a splendid morning, and I was feeling like a million dollars.",
        "I had just got back to London. For the last few weeks I had been on a visit to my Aunt Agatha at her place in the country, and I was tickled to death to be back among the bright lights. I’m a chappie who has to be in the centre of things. The country is all very well, but I was made for Broadway and the Follies. You know how it is. It’s the old, old story. The ancestral estates are all very well, but they are a bit of a drag on a fellow after a while. Give me the wild night-life of London. Give me the—well, you know what I mean."

        "It was a morning when all nature shouted “Fore!” The breeze, as it blew gently up from the south, seemed to whisper “Bingo!” And there was a freshness in the air that spoke of other and better things than the eternal round of the daily grind. It was, in short, one of those mornings when a chap’s soul expands and he feels that all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds.",
        "It was on this particular morning that I had occasion to summon Jeeves. He had been with me for some little time, and I was beginning to rely on his judgment in matters of dress and deportment. He was a man of infinite resource and sagacity. He was, in a word, a brainy cove."

        "I remember the morning well. I was in my rooms in the Albany, and I was feeling more than usually at peace with the world. I had just finished my breakfast, and was glancing through the paper. It was a beautiful day, and the sun was streaming in through the window. I had a sense of well-being. I was a young man in my prime. I had plenty of money. I was a member of the Drones Club. What more could a chap want?",
        "It was at this precise moment that the telephone rang. It was my Aunt Agatha. I could tell it was my Aunt Agatha because her voice had that sort of metallic ring that makes you feel as if you had inadvertently swallowed a nail."

        "It is a curious thing how extraordinarily difficult it is to do a spot of real, solid, uninterrupted thinking. I don’t know whether you have ever noticed it, but the moment you get your mind working on some big, broad, spacious, intellectual problem, something is certain to happen to go and knock the whole thing sideways. It is as if Fate, seeing you trying to do a bit of good, honest, brainy work, said to itself, “Hullo! This won’t do!” and immediately started to dig up a lot of silly, trivial, footling little interruptions to divert your attention.",
        "I was thinking this on the morning on which this story opens. I was in my rooms in the Albany, and I was trying to concentrate my mind on a matter of the most vital importance. It was a matter that required all the brain-power at my command. It was, in short, the question of whether I should wear a blue tie with spots or a plain brown one."

        "I don’t know if you know old Biffy. He is a chappie who is more to be pitied than censured. He is a fellow of infinite jest, and all that sort of thing, but he is one of those chaps who are constitutionally incapable of keeping out of trouble. He is always in the soup. He is the sort of fellow who, if he were to fall into the river, would come up with a fish in his pocket. He is a man of whom it may be said that, if it were not for bad luck, he would have no luck at all.",
        "I met him one morning in the Drones Club. He was looking more than usually sorry for himself. He had a black eye, and his clothes were in a state of some disorder. He was sitting in a corner, with his head in his hands, and he was groaning in a low, despairing sort of way."

        "It was in the smoking-room of the Drones Club that I came across Sippy. He was looking rather pleased with himself. He was a small, stout, pink-faced man, with a bald head and a cheerful, optimistic disposition. He was a man who was always seeing the bright side of things. He was a man who, if he were to be shipwrecked on a desert island, would immediately start to look for a silver lining to the cloud.",
        "He greeted me with a cheery smile. “Hullo, Bertie,” he said. “I’ve got some good news for you.”"

        "It was my Aunt Agatha who rang me up. She had a way of ringing me up at the most inconvenient moments. She was a woman of strong character and decided views. She was a woman who, if she had been a man, would have been a sergeant-major in the Guards. She was a woman who believed in doing things at once. She was a woman who, if she had been a general, would have won the war in a week.",
        "She had a voice like a fog-horn. “Bertie,” she said, “I want you to come down here at once.”"

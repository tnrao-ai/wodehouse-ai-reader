        "Into the calm life of George Bevan, the American composer, living quietly in his flat in Piccadilly, there came one day an automobile. It was a large, red automobile, and it came with a good deal of fuss and circumstance. It was one of those cars which seem to have been built for the purpose of impressing upon the world the fact that their owners have a great deal of money. It was a car that hooted, and tooted, and snorted, and bellowed, and in general behaved as if it were the only car in the world. It was a car that made you feel that you were a very small and insignificant person indeed.",
        "George Bevan, who was a modest young man, was not in the habit of feeling small and insignificant, but he did so on this occasion. He was standing on the pavement, waiting for a bus, when the red car came swooping round the corner, and all but ran him down. It missed him by a hair’s breadth, and went on its way, leaving him with a vague sense of having been insulted. He was not a man who was easily roused to anger, but he felt a distinct desire to throw something at the back of the car as it disappeared down the street. He restrained himself, however, and went on waiting for his bus.",
        "The bus, when it came, was crowded, and he had to stand. He did not mind this, for he was a young man of simple tastes, and was not accustomed to luxury. He was a composer, and had come to London to compose. He had composed a musical comedy, which had been produced, and had run for a year. He was now composing another. He was a serious young man, with a high forehead and a firm chin. He was also a very rich young man. His father had been a millionaire, and had left him all his money. George had a flat in Piccadilly, a valet, a motor-car, and everything that a young man could desire. He was, in fact, a very fortunate young man.",
        "But he was not happy. He was a man of moods, and at the present moment he was in one of his blackest. He was a man who took life seriously, and he was oppressed by a sense of its utter futility. He was a man who wanted to do something big, and he felt that he was doing nothing at all. He had written a successful musical comedy, but what was that? A thing of froth and bubble, a thing that was here to-day and gone to-morrow. He wanted to write something that would live, something that would be remembered after he was dead. He wanted to write a great opera, a great symphony, a great oratorio. And he felt that he would never do it. He was a failure, and he knew it.",
        "He was in this frame of mind when he reached his flat. He let himself in with his latch-key, and went into the sitting-room. It was a large and comfortable room, furnished with taste and discrimination. There were books in the bookcases, pictures on the walls, and flowers in the vases. It was the room of a man of culture and refinement. But to George Bevan, in his present mood, it was a prison. He threw himself into a chair and stared moodily at the fire.",
        "He was aroused from his reverie by the entrance of his valet. The valet was a man of middle age, with a grave and respectful demeanour. He was a man who had seen life, and had formed his own conclusions about it. He was a man who knew his place, and kept it. He was, in short, a perfect valet.",
        "‘A lady to see you, sir,’ he said.",
        "George Bevan sat up. A lady? He was not in the habit of receiving ladies in his flat. He was a shy and retiring young man, and he did not care for the society of women. He was a man who had been disappointed in love, and had renounced the sex. He was a man who had a broken heart.",
        "‘A lady?’ he said. ‘What sort of a lady?’",
        "‘A young lady, sir.’",
        "‘Did she give her name?’",
        "‘No, sir. She said you would not know it.’",
        "‘Did she say what she wanted?’",
        "‘No, sir. She said it was a matter of the utmost importance.’",
        "George Bevan hesitated. He was not in the mood for visitors. He was in the mood for solitude and introspection. He was in the mood to be alone with his sorrow. But he was a kind-hearted young man, and he could not bring himself to turn a lady away from his door.",
        "‘Show her in,’ he said.",
        "The valet retired, and a moment later the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was a very beautiful young lady, with large, dark eyes and a cloud of black hair. She was dressed in black, and wore a thick veil. She was a young lady who was obviously in distress.",
        "She came forward and stood before him, with her hands clasped and her head bent. She was the picture of woe.",
        "‘Mr. Bevan?’ she said.",
        "‘Yes,’ said George.",
        "‘I have come to you for help.’",
        "‘Help?’ said George. ‘What can I do for you?’",
        "‘You can save me.’",
        "‘Save you? From what?’",
        "‘From a terrible fate.’",
        "She raised her veil, and George saw that her eyes were full of tears. He was a susceptible young man, and his heart was touched. He was a man who had a soft spot for beauty in distress. He was a man who was a born knight-errant.",
        "‘Tell me all about it,’ he said.",
        "She told him all about it. It was a long and complicated story, and it took a long time to tell. It was a story of a cruel guardian, a forced marriage, and a secret lover. It was a story that had been told many times before, and would be told many times again. But to George Bevan, in his present mood, it was a story of absorbing interest. He listened with rapt attention, and when she had finished he was a changed man. He was no longer a gloomy and despondent young man, oppressed by a sense of the futility of life. He was a man with a purpose, a man with a mission. He was a man who had found his vocation.",
        "‘I will help you,’ he said."

        "In a bedroom at Belpher Castle, on the morning after George Bevan’s meeting with the mysterious lady in black, a young man was seated at a dressing-table, gazing at his reflection in the mirror. He was a pleasant-faced young man, with a freckled nose and a pair of humorous blue eyes. He was dressed in a suit of pyjamas of a dazzling design, and he was engaged in the delicate operation of waxing his moustache.",
        "This was Reggie Byng, the stepson of the Earl of Marshmoreton. He was a young man of simple tastes, and he had few ambitions. He wanted to live in the country, and breed dogs. He wanted to marry a girl named Alice, who was a chorus-girl at the Regal Theatre. And he wanted to be left alone. He was a young man who asked very little of life.",
        "He had just completed the waxing of his moustache to his satisfaction, when the door opened and a girl came into the room. She was a pretty girl, with a determined chin and a pair of large, grey eyes. She was dressed in a tailor-made suit of tweed, and she looked as if she were a girl who was used to having her own way.",
        "This was Lady Maud Marsh, the daughter of the Earl of Marshmoreton. She was a girl of strong character, and she had a great deal of influence over her brother. She was a girl who was accustomed to managing people.",
        "‘Reggie,’ she said, ‘I want to talk to you.’",
        "Reggie Byng sighed. He knew what was coming. He knew that his sister was about to give him a lecture. He was a young man who was very fond of his sister, but he did not enjoy her lectures.",
        "‘What is it?’ he said.",
        "‘It’s about this girl,’ she said.",
        "‘What girl?’",
        "‘This chorus-girl you’re always with.’",
        "‘Alice?’",
        "‘Yes, Alice. I want you to give her up.’",
        "Reggie Byng’s pleasant face hardened. He was a young man of a placid disposition, but he had a will of his own. He was a young man who was not to be bullied.",
        "‘I won’t,’ he said.",
        "‘You must,’ she said.",
        "‘I won’t.’",
        "‘Reggie, be reasonable. You can’t marry a chorus-girl.’",
        "‘Why not?’",
        "‘Because it wouldn’t do. It would be a mésalliance. It would be a social impossibility.’",
        "‘I don’t care about that.’",
        "‘But I do. And so does father. And so does everybody.’",
        "‘I don’t care about everybody.’",
        "‘But you must. You can’t fly in the face of public opinion.’",
        "‘I can, and I will.’",
        "‘Reggie, you’re being very foolish.’",
        "‘I’m not. I’m being very sensible. I’m in love with Alice, and I’m going to marry her.’",
        "‘You’re not in love with her. You’re only infatuated.’",
        "‘I am in love with her.’",
        "‘You’re not. You’re just a silly boy who has been caught by a pretty face.’",
        "‘I’m not a silly boy. I’m a man. And I’m in love with Alice.’",
        "‘You’re not. You’re a fool.’",
        "‘I’m not a fool.’",
        "‘You are.’",
        "‘I’m not.’",
        "‘You are.’",
        "‘I’m not.’",
        "‘You are.’",
        "The argument might have gone on indefinitely, but at this moment the door opened and a third person entered the room. This was a man of middle age, with a benevolent face and a pair of kindly blue eyes. He was dressed in the costume of a country gentleman, and he had a genial and placid air.",
        "This was the Earl of Marshmoreton. He was a man of a mild and amiable disposition, and he was very fond of his children. He was a man who hated rows.",
        "‘What’s all this?’ he said. ‘What’s all this?’",
        "‘It’s Reggie,’ said Lady Maud. ‘He’s being impossible.’",
        "‘What’s the matter with him?’",
        "‘He says he’s going to marry a chorus-girl.’",
        "The Earl of Marshmoreton looked at his son with a pained expression. He was a man of a conventional turn of mind, and he did not approve of chorus-girls. He was a man who had a great respect for the traditions of his family.",
        "‘Reggie, my boy,’ he said, ‘you can’t do that.’",
        "‘I can, and I will,’ said Reggie.",
        "‘But, my dear boy, think of the scandal.’",
        "‘I don’t care about the scandal.’",
        "‘But I do. And so does Maud. And so does everybody.’",
        "‘I don’t care about everybody.’",
        "‘But you must. You can’t fly in the face of public opinion.’",
        "‘I can, and I will.’",
        "‘Reggie, my boy, you’re breaking my heart.’",
        "‘I’m sorry, father, but I can’t help it. I’m in love with Alice, and I’m going to marry her.’",
        "The Earl of Marshmoreton sighed. He was a man of a pacific nature, and he did not know what to do. He was a man who was not accustomed to dealing with difficult situations.",
        "‘Well, well,’ he said, ‘we’ll talk about it later. Don’t let’s have a row about it now. It’s a beautiful morning. Let’s go out and get some fresh air.’",
        "He went out of the room, followed by his daughter. Reggie Byng was left alone. He went back to the dressing-table and looked at his reflection in the mirror. He was a young man who was very much in love, and he was very unhappy."

He was a man who had a large correspondence, and he enjoyed answering his letters. He was a man who had a great deal of leisure, and he did not know what to do with it.",
        "He was interrupted by the entrance of his daughter. Lady Maud came into the room with a determined air. She was a girl who was not accustomed to being thwarted.",

        "‘A reporter?’ he said. ‘That sounds a very good idea. A very good idea indeed.’",
        "‘Of course it is,’ said Lady Maud. ‘It’s the very thing for him. It would take him out of himself, and give him something to think about. It would make a man of him.’",
        "The Earl of Marshmoreton was convinced. He was a man of an optimistic turn of mind, and he was always ready to believe the best of everyone.",
        "‘You’re quite right, my dear,’ he said. ‘It’s a capital idea. I’ll speak to Bevan about it at once.’",

He was a young man who preferred to sit and think.",

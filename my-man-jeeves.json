      "content": [
        "I'm not absolutely certain of my facts, but I rather fancy it's Shakespeare who says that it's always just when a chappie is feeling particularly top-hole, and more than usually braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with a bit of lead piping. There's no doubt the man was right. It's been that way with me time and again.",
        "Take, for instance, the business of my Aunt Agatha and the Stolen Stays. The first intimation I had that things were about to go wrong was on a morning in early spring, when I was brushing my hair. It was a splendid morning, and I was feeling like a million dollars.",
        "I had just got back to London. For the last few weeks I had been on a visit to my Aunt Agatha at her place in the country, and I was tickled to death to be back among the bright lights. I’m a chappie who has to be in the centre of things. The country is all very well, but I was made for Broadway and the Follies. You know how it is. It’s the old, old story. The ancestral estates are all very well, but they are a bit of a drag on a fellow after a while. Give me the wild night-life of London. Give me the—well, you know what I mean.",
        "It was on this particular morning that Jeeves came in with the breakfast-tray. He’s a chappie I had engaged a few weeks before. A fellow I had met at a club had recommended him to me. Said he was a treasure. And he was. It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that Jeeves is the fellow who has made me what I am. He’s a sort of valet-butler-secretary-courier-and-general-factotum rolled into one. He’s a man of the most amazing resource and sagacity. He can do anything. I believe that if I were to find myself in a Turkish bath with a brace of man-eating tigers, and Jeeves were to stroll in, he would find some way of getting me out of it.",
        "‘Good morning, Jeeves,’ I said.",
        "‘Good morning, sir,’ he said. ‘A fine morning.’",
        "‘What’s in the mail?’",
        "‘One letter, sir. It has the Worplesdon postmark.’",
        "My heart gave a leap. Florence Craye, you know. Lord Worplesdon’s daughter. The girl I was engaged to. I had been expecting a letter from her for days.",
        "I tore open the envelope. And then I uttered a cry of anguish.",
        "‘Jeeves!’ I said.",
        "‘Sir?’",
        "‘Read this.’",
        "He took the letter and perused it in his calm, respectful way.",
        "‘H’m,’ he said.",
        "‘What do you make of it?’",
        "‘It would appear, sir, that Miss Craye has completed her novel.’",
        "‘Her novel, Jeeves! It’s not a novel. It’s a chunk of cheese. It’s the most awful rot you ever read. It’s the sort of book that makes you feel you want to take a bath. It’s all about a girl who is a kleptomaniac and pinches things from shops. Stays and things, you know. And my Aunt Agatha has read it.’",
        "‘Indeed, sir?’",
        "‘And she’s taken a most frightful down on it. She says it’s immoral and decadent and all the rest of it. She says that a girl who could write a book like that is not a fit wife for her nephew. And she’s told me that if I marry Florence she’ll cut off my allowance.’",
        "‘That would be a severe blow, sir.’",
        "‘It would be more than a blow, Jeeves. It would be a catastrophe. You know as well as I do that I’m entirely dependent on my Aunt Agatha. Without her, I’m a wanderer on the face of the earth. I should have to go to work.’",
        "‘Yes, sir.’",
        "‘And the ghastly part of it is that Florence is as proud as Lucifer. If I were to tell her that my aunt had forbidden the banns, she would break off the engagement in a minute. She would say that she refused to enter a family where she was not welcome. She’s that sort of girl.’",
        "‘Yes, sir.’",
        "‘So you see the position I’m in. If I marry Florence, I’m a pauper. If I don’t marry her, I’m a broken-hearted chappie who has lost the only girl he ever loved. It’s a toss-up which is worse.’",
        "‘A difficult problem, sir.’",
        "‘And I’ve been brooding over it for days. I can’t see a way out. I’m stumped.’",
        "‘If I might make a suggestion, sir?’",
        "‘A suggestion, Jeeves? You have a suggestion?’",
        "‘It occurred to me, sir, that if you were to write a novel yourself, a novel of a particularly wholesome and uplifting character, and if you were to dedicate it to your aunt, it might have the effect of counteracting the unfortunate impression created by Miss Craye’s work.’",
        "I stared at him. The man was a genius. I saw it all in a flash. It was a master-stroke. It was the goods. It was the stuff to give the troops.",
        "‘Jeeves,’ I said, ‘you’re a marvel. You’re a wonder. You’re a wizard. How the dickens do you think of these things?’",
        "‘It is my business to think of things, sir.’",
        "‘But what sort of a book could I write?’",
        "‘I would suggest a simple, straightforward story of country life, sir. Something with a good deal of healthy, outdoor interest. A story, in short, which would be likely to appeal to a lady of your aunt’s tastes.’",
        "‘But I’ve never written a book in my life.’",
        "‘I would be happy to assist you in the technical details, sir. I have a certain amount of experience in these matters.’",
        "‘You have?’",
        "‘Yes, sir. I have on several occasions contributed to the periodical press.’",
        "‘You astound me, Jeeves. Well, in that case, we might be able to put it through. We’ll start at once.’"

        "I was in my rooms in the Albany, sipping a cocktail and reading a book of poetry. It was a beautiful day, and the sun was streaming in through the window. I had a sense of well-being. I was a young man in my prime. I had plenty of money. I was a member of the Drones Club. What more could a chap want?",
        "It was at this precise moment that the telephone rang. It was my Aunt Agatha. I could tell it was my Aunt Agatha because her voice had that sort of metallic ring that makes you feel as if you had inadvertently swallowed a nail.",
        "‘Bertie,’ she said, ‘I want you to come down here at once.’",
        "‘Yes, Aunt Agatha,’ I said.",
        "‘I have a young man staying with me. His name is Motty. He is the son of an old friend of mine, Lady Pershore. I want you to take him in hand.’",
        "‘Take him in hand, Aunt Agatha?’",
        "‘Yes. He is a very shy, nervous boy, and he needs a man’s influence. I want you to take him about and show him London. I want you to be a brother to him.’",
        "‘A brother, Aunt Agatha?’",
        "‘Yes. And I want you to see that he doesn’t get into any mischief.’",
        "‘Mischief, Aunt Agatha?’",
        "‘Yes. He is a very impressionable boy, and he is easily led astray. I want you to keep an eye on him.’",
        "‘Keep an eye on him, Aunt Agatha?’",
        "‘Yes. And above all, I want you to see that he doesn’t drink.’",
        "‘Drink, Aunt Agatha?’",
        "‘Yes. He has a tendency to be a little wild. I want you to be a good influence on him.’",
        "‘A good influence, Aunt Agatha?’",
        "‘Yes. Now, don’t keep repeating everything I say, Bertie. It’s a very irritating habit. Come down at once.’",
        "She rang off, and I was left with the receiver in my hand, feeling that my beautiful day had been spoiled. I didn’t want to be a brother to a shy, nervous boy named Motty. I didn’t want to take him about and show him London. I didn’t want to keep an eye on him. And I certainly didn’t want to see that he didn’t drink.",
        "However, there was nothing for it. An aunt is an aunt, and when she issues a command, it has to be obeyed.",
        "I went down to my aunt’s place in the country. It was a large and gloomy house, surrounded by a large and gloomy park. My aunt was a large and gloomy woman, with a large and gloomy husband. They were both very fond of me, but they had a way of making me feel as if I were a small boy who had been caught stealing jam.",
        "Motty was a small, pale, frightened-looking youth, with a long nose and a receding chin. He had a way of looking at you as if he were expecting you to hit him. He was not what you would call a prepossessing young man.",
        "I did my best to be a brother to him. I took him to the Zoo, and the Tower of London, and Madame Tussaud’s. I took him to the theatre, and the music-halls, and the night-clubs. I did my best to show him London.",
        "But he was not an easy chap to entertain. He was a silent and morose young man. He had a way of sitting and staring into space for hours at a time. He seemed to have something on his mind.",
        "One evening, we were sitting in the stalls at a musical comedy. It was a very bright and cheerful show, with a lot of pretty girls and a lot of catchy tunes. I was enjoying it immensely. But Motty was not enjoying it at all. He was sitting with his chin on his chest, staring at the stage with a look of profound melancholy.",
        "‘What’s the matter, Motty?’ I said. ‘Don’t you like the show?’",
        "‘It’s all right,’ he said.",
        "‘You don’t seem very cheerful.’",
        "‘I’m not,’ he said.",
        "‘What’s the trouble?’",
        "‘It’s my mother,’ he said.",
        "‘Your mother? What about her?’",
        "‘She’s a very strict woman,’ he said. ‘She has very strong views about things.’",
        "‘Such as?’",
        "‘Such as drinking, and smoking, and gambling, and going to music-halls, and staying out late at night.’",
        "‘I see,’ I said. ‘She doesn’t approve of these things?’",
        "‘She does not,’ he said. ‘And she’s coming to London to-morrow.’",
        "‘Is she?’ I said. ‘Well, that’s all right, isn’t it? You’ll be able to see her.’",
        "‘That’s just the trouble,’ he said. ‘I don’t want to see her.’",
        "‘Why not?’",
        "‘Because I’ve been doing all the things she doesn’t approve of.’",
        "‘Have you?’ I said. ‘I hadn’t noticed it.’",
        "‘You wouldn’t,’ he said. ‘I’ve been doing them on the quiet.’",
        "‘I see,’ I said. ‘Well, that was very wrong of you, Motty.’",
        "‘I know it was,’ he said. ‘But I couldn’t help it. I was led astray.’",
        "‘Who by?’",
        "‘By you,’ he said.",
        "‘By me?’ I said. ‘My dear Motty, I’ve been a brother to you.’",

The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and there was a general air of cheerfulness and optimism about the place. I was feeling particularly braced. I had had a good breakfast, and I was wearing a new suit of plus-fours that fitted me like a glove. I was, in short, at peace with the world.",

        "I looked at him closely. There was something vaguely familiar about his face, but I couldn’t place him.",

I was in a mood of gentle and benevolent meditation.",

        "I looked up, and saw a small, stout, pink-faced man, with a bald head and a cheerful, optimistic expression. He was a man who looked as if he had never had a care in the world. He was a man who looked as if he had been born with a silver spoon in his mouth.",

        "‘Hullo, Sippy,’ I said. ‘What’s the good word?’",

        "It was my Aunt Agatha who sent me to see Freddie. She had a way of sending me on errands of mercy. She was a woman of strong character and decided views. She was a woman who, if she had been a man, would have been a sergeant-major in the Guards. She was a woman who believed in doing things at once. She was a woman who, if she had been a general, would have won the war in a week.",
        "She rang me up one morning when I was in the middle of a most important piece of work. I was trying to decide whether to wear a blue tie with spots or a plain brown one. It was a matter that required the most careful consideration, and I was giving it all the brain-power at my command.",
        "‘Bertie,’ she said, ‘I want you to go and see Freddie.’",
